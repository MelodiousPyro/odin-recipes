        <H3>Description:</H3>
        <p>
            This cut of meat originating in California is one of my favorite cuts of meat to smoke.
            It is great for hosting parties being a larger amount of meat for a still reasonable price.
            I love this recipe for meal prepping and it is so easy to make with a smoker, which leaves the meat tender and juicy.
