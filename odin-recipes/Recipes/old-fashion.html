        <H3>Description:</H3>
            <P>This classic Whiskey drink is one of my all time favorites.
                A smooth drink when added with an orange slice/rind or cocktail cherries to give a nice fruity finish.
                Created in 1880 as an ode to how they made the drink in the days of ol' from a bartender named James E. Pepper.
                He eventually took this drink to the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York where it became famous and remains the same today.
