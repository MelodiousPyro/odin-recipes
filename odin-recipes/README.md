This is my first project in Odin.
The goal is to create a website and show what I've learned so far in the foundations portion of The Odin Project.
Once completed, I will have shown the ability to create a simplistic website with multiple pages. The ability to Produce links to other websties, create lists, etc.
I don't fully understand Git commit messages so this will be practice for that as well
